    "### Q1. What is the purpose of Python's OOP?\n",
    "Ans:In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming. It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming. It gives freedom to user to write code according to his/her functionality. And implement reusability of code."

    "### Q2. Where does an inheritance search look for an attribute?\n",
    "Ans:An inheritance search looks for an attribute first in the instance object, then in the class the instance was created from, then in all higher superclasses, progressing from left to right (by default)."

    "### Q3. How do you distinguish between a class object and an instance object?\n",
    "Ans: A class is a blue print for creating objects in a program, whereas the object is an instance of a class. A class is a logical entity, while an object is a physical entity. A class does not allocate memory space; on the other hand, an object allocates memory space."

    "Ans: A class method is similar to an instance method, but it has a class object passed as its first argument. Recall that, when an instance method is called from an instance object, that instance object is automatically passed as the first argument to the method."
